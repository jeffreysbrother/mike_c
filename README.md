#Simple Site Enhancement#

I re-built an existing site (retaining the original design), then made improvements to its code base and user interface. The site is now completely responsive and features a contact form. I also added a bit of jQuery to improve the user experience.

Superfluous CSS rules were eliminated and invalid HTML was replaced with valid code. Maintainability was improved by moving the header and footer code to "include" files.
