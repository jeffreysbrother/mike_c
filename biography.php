      <h2>About Michael</h2>

      <p>Michael Chambers is a composer, songwriter, and producer.</p>

      <p>At an early age Michael was captivated by film music and it's powerful psychological impact on human emotions. He began teaching himself to play piano by ear after listening to and watching his older sister practice. He would often plunk out his favorite movie themes and create variations around them. This sparked a new passion for composition. Over the years he would begin branching out musically, teaching himself guitar and drums while writing songs and leading several bands.</p>

      <p>After graduating from Berklee College of Music, Chambers moved back to his hometown, Los Angeles and started the band The Swell Dive. He has scored several short films, advertisements, and web-series.</p>

      <p>Currently, Michael works as an assistant to film composer David Kitay (Clueless, Look Who's Talking, Dude Where's My Car).</p>
